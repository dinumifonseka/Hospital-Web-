        How we provide emergency care?

    </h3>
    <p>
       
On arrival the patient is assessed and referred to a doctor at the ETU.
Acute trauma patients are transferred to a sterile dressing area.
Patients in need of other procedures such as antibiotic administration, catheter changes or NG tube insertions are transferred to the required station.
After the initial management of patients who require cardiac procedures/ care or intensive care, they are transferred to the relevant unit or ward for further care.
Multi-parameter monitoring (including monitoring while on transfer) is possible at this unit which is geared to handle a vast variety of trauma conditions.
The patients who come to the ETU and require emergency management for heart attack or stroke will be treated in our fully fledged catheterization laboratories.
